   ```javascript
    /**
    * @param preferences - an array of integers. Indices of people, whom they love
    * @returns number of love triangles
    */
    module.exports = function getLoveTrianglesCount(preferences = []) {
    let count = 0;

    preferences = preferences.map( item => item - 1);

    for (let i = 0; i < preferences.length; i++) {
        first = preferences[i]; //whom love first lover
        second = preferences[first];  //whom love second lover
        third = preferences[second];  //whom love third lover

        //if 3rd lover love 1st lover in chain - then it's a love triangle
        if ((i == third) && (first != second) && (second != third)) {
        preferences[i] = -1;  //exclude this triangle from cheking
        preferences[first] = -1;
        preferences[third] = -1;
