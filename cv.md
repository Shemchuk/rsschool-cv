* @returns number of love triangles
*/
module.exports = function getLoveTrianglesCount(preferences = []) {
let count = 0;

preferences = preferences.map( item => item - 1);

for (let i = 0; i < preferences.length; i++) {
    first = preferences[i]; //whom love first lover
    second = preferences[first];  //whom love second lover
    third = preferences[second];  //whom love third lover

    //if 3rd lover love 1st lover in chain - then it's a love triangle
    if ((i == third) && (first != second) && (second != third)) {
    preferences[i] = -1;  //exclude this triangle from cheking
    preferences[first] = -1;
